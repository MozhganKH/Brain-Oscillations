First, to create a small-world network, run kRegularNetwork.cpp
Notice the condition of in- and out-degrees


Then, to obtain different activity regimes on a small-world, run CodeForKregularSmallWorldNet.cpp
For each phase, select an appropriate noise intensity in the implementation code.


For the power spectrum and to plot results, use the Jupyter file. 
For a more exact power spectrum, choose tmax more than 20000 time steps.
