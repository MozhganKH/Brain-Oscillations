To create a k-regular network, run kRegularNetwork.cpp
Notice the condition of in- and out-degrees.


To obtain different activity regimes on a k-regular network, run CodeForKregularNet.cpp
For each phase, select an appropriate noise intensity in the implementation code.


For the power spectrum and to plot results, use the Jupyter file. 
For a more exact power spectrum, choose tmax more than 20000 time steps.
