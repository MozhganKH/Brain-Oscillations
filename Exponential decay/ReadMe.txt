To obtain different activity regimes on the ER network with an exponential decay of synapse activation, run CodeForExponentialDecay.cpp
For each phase, select an appropriate noise intensity in the implementation code.
Notice the appropriate cut-off for the activation of synapses.

For the power spectrum and to plot results, use the Jupyter file. 
For a more exact power spectrum, choose tmax more than 20000 time steps.
